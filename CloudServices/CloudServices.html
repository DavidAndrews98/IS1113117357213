        <p style="font-family:Arial;">Software as a service (or SaaS) is a way of delivering centrally hosted applications over the Internet as a service. SaaS applications are sometimes called web-based software, on-demand software, or hosted software. Whatever the name, SaaS applications run on a SaaS provider's servers.

Instead of installing and maintaining software, you simply access it via the Internet, freeing yourself from complex software and hardware management. The provider manages access to the application, including security, availability, and performance. SaaS business applications are usually accessed by users using a thin client via a web browser.

       <h3 style="font-family:arial;"><a href = "https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/?origin=c9io">Platform as a Service (PaaS) - Cloud 9</a></h3>
        <p style="font-family:Arial;">Platform as a service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model in which a third-party provider delivers hardware and software tools, usually those needed for application development, to users over the internet. A PaaS provider hosts the hardware and software on its own infrastructure. As a result, PaaS frees users from having to install in-house hardware and software to develop or run a new application. 

Cloud9 is an example of a business operating a Paas. 

The principal benefit of PaaS is simplicity and convenience for users -- the PaaS provider supplies much of the infrastructure and other IT services, which users can access anywhere via a web browser. PaaS providers then charge for that access on a per-use basis -- a model that many enterprises prefer, as it eliminates the capital expenses they traditionally have for on-premises hardware and software.

       <h3 style="font-family:arial;"><a href = "https://aws.amazon.com/">Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - Amazon</a></h3>
        <p style="font-family:Arial;">Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a form of cloud computing that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. In an IaaS model, a cloud provider hosts the infrastructure components traditionally present in an on-premises data center, including servers, storage and networking hardware, as well as the virtualization or hypervisor layer. The IaaS provider also supplies a range of services to accompany those infrastructure components. These can include detailed billing, monitoring, log access, security, load balancing and clustering, as well as storage resiliency, such as backup, replication and recovery. 

Amazon is a primary example of a company offering IaaS. 

Organizations choose IaaS because it is often easier, faster and more cost-efficient to operate a workload without having to buy, manage and support the underlying infrastructure. With IaaS, a business can simply rent or lease that infrastructure from another business.

       <h3 style="font-family:arial;"><a href = "https://www.google.com/gmail/about/#">Communication as a Service (CaaS) - Gmail</a></h3>
        <p style="font-family:Arial;">Communications as a Service (CaaS) is an outsourced enterprise communications solution that can be leased from a single vendor. Such communications can include voice over IP (VoIP or Internet telephony), instant messaging (IM), collaboration and videoconference applications using fixed and mobile devices. CaaS has evolved along the same lines as Software as a Service (SaaS). The CaaS vendor is responsible for all hardware and software management and offers guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS). CaaS allows businesses to selectively deploy communications devices and modes on a pay-as-you-go, as-needed basis. This approach eliminates the large capital investment and ongoing overhead for a system whose capacity may often exceed or fall short of current demand. 

An example of CaaS is Google's Gmail . 

CaaS offers flexibility and expandability that small and medium-sized business might not otherwise afford, allowing for the addition of devices, modes or coverage on demand. The network capacity and feature set can be changed from day to day if necessary so that functionality keeps pace with demand and resources are not wasted. There is no risk of the system becoming obsolete and requiring periodic major upgrades or replacement
