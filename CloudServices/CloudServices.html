       <h3 style="font-family:arial;"><a href = "https://www.salesforce.com/saas/">Software as a Service - Salesforce</a></h3>
        <p style="font-family:Arial;">Software as a service (or SaaS) is a way of delivering centrally hosted applications over the Internet as a service. SaaS applications are sometimes called web-based software, on-demand software, or hosted software. Whatever the name, SaaS applications run on a SaaS providerâ€™s servers.

Instead of installing and maintaining software, you simply access it via the Internet, freeing yourself from complex software and hardware management. The provider manages access to the application, including security, availability, and performance. SaaS business applications are usually accessed by users using a thin client via a web browser.

        <h3 style="font-family:arial;">My Club</h3>
        <p style="font-family:Arial;">I play for a small junior club called <a href= "http://www.shamrocksgaa.com/">Shamrocks GAA</a>. The club was founded in 1984 in the Shanbally/Ringaskiddy/Monkstown parish. We are a small club with about 200 members in total. I've been playing since I was 5 years old. </p>
