        <h3>What is the cloud ?</h3>

        <p>The first thing you should understand about the cloud 
        is that it is not a physical thing. So like that picture you cannot touch the cloud. 
        The cloud is a network of servers, 
        and each server has a different function. 
        Some servers use computing power to run applications or "deliver a service."

            <h3>Brief History</h3>
          <p></p>  <p>The history of the cloud dates back as far as the 1950s. Back then, a mainframe was so big it took up an entire room. Because mainframes were so expensive, organizations couldn't afford to purchase a new one for each user. In response, they developed "time sharing" methods, which let multiple users share access to data and CPU time. 
The next major event in cloud computing history occurred in 1969, when J.C.R. Licklider developed ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) in hopes that some day everyone would be able to access data and programs from any location.
Despite these early advances, the Internet didn't feature enough bandwidth to make the cloud available to the masses until the '90s.
Professor Ramnath Chellappa was the first to use the term "cloud computing" in 1997, and in 1999, Salesforce became the first site to deliver applications and software over the Internet.
Amazon officially launched its own cloud computing platform called Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2006. AWS provides online services to websites or client-side applications.
Chances are, you come in contact with AWS daily. Social media sites like Instagram and Pinterest use AWS to host traffic and data. In fact, AWS powers hundreds of thousands of startups and larger companies in over 190 countries worldwide.
